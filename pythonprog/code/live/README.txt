This directory contains the raw code as found on Dave's laptop
computer upon conclusion of the recording session for the LiveLesson.
It's not especially well organized and may be missing earlier versions
of code developed as lessons progressed.  However, it's been included
as a potentially useful cross-reference to the more organized code
samples.  Your mileage might vary.
